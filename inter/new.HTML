      ENGALURU: India’s biggest rocket — parts of which will be reusable —
      critical to building the country’s own space station and eventually
      sending Indians to Moon, is not just on paper anymore. After several
      months of initial planning and finalising of design and architecture, Isro
      has formalised a project team to start building the New Generation Launch
      Vehicle (NGLV), which will also require a new launch pad at the spaceport
      in Sriharikota.
